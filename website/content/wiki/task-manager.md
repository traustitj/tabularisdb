# Task Manager

The **Task Manager** is a built-in system monitor focused on Tabularis itself and the plugin processes it spawns. It lets you see resource consumption at a glance and take direct action — restart a misbehaving plugin or force-kill it — without leaving the application.

Open it from **Settings → Plugins**, using the **Open Task Manager** button in the Task Manager section.

## Interface Overview

The Task Manager window is divided into three panels:

### 1. System Resources

A real-time summary of the host machine:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Total CPU usage across all cores |
| **RAM** | Used memory with a visual bar (used / total) |
| **Disk Read/s** | Aggregate read throughput |
| **Disk Write/s** | Aggregate write throughput |

A process count is also shown at the bottom of this panel.

### 2. Tabularis Process

Stats for the Tabularis process itself (the Tauri/Rust backend):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CPU** | CPU usage of the main process |
| **RAM** | Memory consumed by the main process |
| **Disk Read/s** | Read I/O rate |
| **Disk Write/s** | Write I/O rate |
| **PID** | Operating system process ID |

If Tabularis has spawned child processes (e.g., WebView2 on Windows), you can expand the row to see each child's PID, name, CPU, and RAM.

### 3. Plugin Processes

A sortable table of all active plugin driver processes. Each row represents one running plugin.

**Columns:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Plugin | Plugin name (with child process count if any) |
| PID | OS process ID |
| CPU | CPU usage percentage |
| RAM | Resident memory usage |
| Disk R/W | Read and write throughput |
| Status | `running`, `stopped`, or other states |
| Actions | Restart / Kill buttons |

Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.

If a plugin has spawned sub-processes (e.g., a language runtime), expand the row with the chevron to inspect each child process individually.

## Actions

### Restart a Plugin

Click **Restart** on any plugin row. Tabularis will send a stop signal to the process and re-launch it from the same manifest. Active queries through that plugin will be interrupted.

### Kill a Plugin

Click **Kill** to force-terminate a plugin immediately. A confirmation modal appears before the action is executed to prevent accidental kills. The plugin process will not be restarted automatically.

### Refresh

Click the **Refresh** button in the top-right corner to fetch a fresh snapshot of all stats. The page does not auto-refresh to avoid constant background polling.

## When to Use It

- A plugin is consuming unexpected amounts of CPU or memory.
- A plugin has crashed and is stuck in a non-running state.
- You want to reclaim resources from plugins you aren't actively using without uninstalling them.
- You need to find the PID of a plugin subprocess to attach an external debugger.

## Notes

- The Task Manager only shows **plugin** processes in the plugin table. Native drivers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) run inside the Rust backend and do not appear as separate processes.
- Killing a plugin does not uninstall it. It will be available again next time you open a connection that uses that driver.
- On Linux, disk I/O stats require the process to have sufficient permissions to read `/proc`.
