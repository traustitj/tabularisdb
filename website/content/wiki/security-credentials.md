# Security & Credentials

Tabularis follows a strict security principle: **secrets never touch disk in plain text**. All passwords, API keys, and passphrases are stored exclusively in your operating system's native keychain. Non-sensitive metadata (hostnames, ports, usernames) is stored in JSON config files.

## Keychain Backends

| OS | Keychain | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **macOS** | Keychain Access | Managed via the `security` CLI or Keychain Access app |
| **Windows** | Credential Manager | Stored under "Generic Credentials" |
| **Linux** | libsecret (GNOME Keyring / KWallet) | Requires a running secret service (most desktop environments include one) |

Tabularis uses the [`keyring`](https://docs.rs/keyring) Rust crate, which abstracts across all three platforms.

## What Is Stored Where

### In the OS Keychain (encrypted)

| Secret | Keychain key format |
| :--- | :--- |
| Database password | `{connection_id}:db` |
| SSH password | `{connection_id}:ssh` |
| SSH key passphrase | `{connection_id}:ssh_passphrase` |
| AI provider API key | `ai_key:{provider}` |

The keychain service name is `tabularis` for all entries.

### On Disk (plain JSON, non-sensitive)

| File | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| `connections.json` | Connection profiles: name, host, port, username, driver, SSH profile reference |
| `ssh_connections.json` | SSH profiles: host, port, username, key file path |
| `config.json` | App preferences, theme, editor settings |
| `saved_queries/meta.json` | Saved query metadata |

These files live in the app config directory:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/dev.tabularis.app`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.tabularis.app`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\dev.tabularis.app`

## Credential Cache

To avoid hitting the OS keychain on every database operation, Tabularis maintains an in-memory credential cache. The cache uses a simple `HashMap` protected by a `Mutex` with four buckets: database passwords, SSH passwords, SSH passphrases, and AI keys.

Key behaviors:

- **Read-through**: on cache miss, the keychain is queried and the result is cached (including misses, stored as `Absent` to prevent repeated lookups).
- **Write-through**: when you save a password, both the keychain and the cache are updated atomically.
- **Invalidation**: when you delete a connection, the corresponding cache entry and keychain entry are both removed.
- The cache lives only in process memory — it is never written to disk and is cleared when Tabularis exits.

## "Save in Keychain" Toggle

When creating or editing a connection, the **Save in keychain** checkbox controls persistence:

- **Checked** — the password is stored in the OS keychain and loaded automatically on next launch.
- **Unchecked** — the password is held in the in-memory cache for the current session only. After you quit Tabularis, the password is gone.

This applies to database passwords, SSH passwords, and SSH key passphrases.

## Inspecting Keychain Entries

### macOS

```bash
security find-generic-password -s "tabularis" -a "<connection_id>:db" -w
```

### Linux (secret-tool)

```bash
secret-tool lookup service tabularis username "<connection_id>:db"
```

### Windows

Open **Credential Manager → Windows Credentials** and search for entries with `tabularis` in the service name.

## Deleting Credentials

When you delete a connection in Tabularis, the associated keychain entries are automatically removed. To manually clean up orphaned entries, use the OS-specific commands above to find and delete them.

## AI API Keys

AI provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama) follow the same keychain pattern. The key format is `ai_key:<provider>`, where provider is one of `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `custom-openai`. Ollama runs locally and typically does not require an API key.

Re-enter an API key from **Settings → AI** if it stops working — the old keychain entry is overwritten in place.

## Read-Only Mode

For an additional layer of protection, enable **Read-Only Mode** on any connection. Tabularis parses the SQL AST before execution and blocks `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `CREATE`, and `ALTER` statements at the client level. See [Connection Management](/wiki/connections) for details.
